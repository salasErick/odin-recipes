        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Guajillo chile</li>
            <li>Ancho chile</li>
            <li>Garlic cloves</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Tortillas</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <p>Let's start making the sauce. </p>
            <li>
            Start lighting the chiles on a hot griddle, pressing them down with the help of a spatula <br>
            but making sure not to burn them.
            </li>
            <li>
            Once toasted, place them on pot with water and cook them over low heat for 15 minutes <br>
            or until they are soft.
            </li>
            <li>
            Let the chiles cool for about 15 minutes and drain them to place them in the blender along <br>
            with the garlic cloves. Add half a cup of water and blend until obtaining a smooth sauce. <br>
            Season with oregano, salt and pepper.
            </li>

            <p>Now let's work with the tortillas</p>
            <li>In a large pan add 2 tablespoons of oil and heat over medium heat. Then start frying the <br>
            tortillas (add oil as needed).
            </li>
            <li>Dip the tortillas one by one and from both sides until they are well soaked</li>
            <li>Then place the tortilla in the pan with the hot oil and fry both sides (this only takes <br>
            a few seconds) and place the enchilada on a plate.</li>
            <li>Fill the enchiladas with cheese to then fold and roll them just as a flauta.</li>
        </ol>
