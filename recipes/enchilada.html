        <p>As with every dish out there, there isn't a single way to prepare a dish. Some people think it's a disgrace <br>
        for the dish and there's a single and correct way to prepare it, meaning that if you don't have the entire list <br>
        of ingredients following it to the letter, you'd better not make it. People tend to make variations based on <br>
        the ingredients that are available and I believe that being able to improvise while making a dish follows the <br>
        artistry behind cooking.
        </p>

        <p>With this preface in mind, I'd like to show you the way I learned to make enchiladas</p>
