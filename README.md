Project: Recipes

I'm currently learning the basics of HTML and now it is time to put that knowledge into practice and make a website. It's about a recipe
and the purpose is to make the best website I can just with HTML.

I'll focus on mexican cuisine since that's one I've known my entire life and I consume it daily. I'll come back once I finish the website.
